## Course Description

The purpose of the course is to review definitions, theories, methods and underlying assumptions of population health intervention research, to examine the evidence-base for evaluating population health interventions, to review local real-world interventions and discuss evaluation directions and challenges. Students are expected to be engaged participants and co-learners. This is a readings course. There will be reading and discussion every class. You must do the readings to be successful in the course. On-going discussion and evaluation of scope, content, and format will be sought as the course is unfolding.

## Land Acknowledgement

I acknowledge our shared connection to the land and recognize that Indigenous and Métis peoples on Treaty 6 Territory and all Indigenous peoples have been and continue to be stewards for social justice, equity, and land-based education. In the spirit of reconciliation may we all strive to learn and support the work of Indigenous communities as allies and return their land.

## COVID-19

The Department of Community Health and Epidemiology strives to be a leader in COVID-19 prevention. This is both an individual and collective challenge. I will be wearing a mask for teaching a strongly encourage other students and guests to wear a mask for in-person sessions. If you feel sick or unwell, please do not come to class. Every accommodation will be made to support your learning if you are not able to come to class in person. If the University of Saskatchewan policy regarding COVID-19 changes during the course, I will update you as soon as possible and we will adapt the course as needed.
