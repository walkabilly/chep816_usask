## Course Description

The purpose of the course is to review definitions, theories, methods and underlying assumptions of population health intervention research, to examine the evidence-base for evaluating population health interventions, to review local real-world interventions and discuss evaluation directions and challenges. Students are expected to be engaged participants and co-learners. This is a readings course. There will be reading and discussion every class. You must do the readings to be successful in the course. On-going discussion and evaluation of scope, content, and format will be sought as the course is unfolding.

## Land Acknowledgement

I acknowledge our shared connection to the land and recognize that Indigenous and Métis peoples on Treaty 6 Territory and all Indigenous peoples have been and continue to be stewards for social justice, equity, and land-based education. In the spirit of reconciliation may we all strive to learn and support the work of Indigenous communities as allies and return their land.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence in Education

There is no general policy on AI tools at the University of Saskatchewan (August 9, 2023). The University has developed high level guidance basec on the [European Network for Academic Integrity (ENAI) recommendations](https://edintegrity.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-023-00133-4). They are summarised below

1. Acknowledge AI tools: “All persons, sources, and tools that influence the ideas or generate the content should be properly acknowledged” (p. 3). Acknowledgement may be done in different ways, according to context and discipline, and should include the input to the tool.
2. Do not list AI tools as authors: Authors must take responsibility and be accountable for content and an AI tool cannot do so.
3. Recognize limits and biases of AI tools: Inaccuracies, errors, and bias are reproduced in AI tools in part because of the human produced materials used for training.

### AI Rules for this course

__In general, my opinion is that you should exploring these tools, what they can do, and how you can integrate them into your work.__ These tools are great for editing, formatting, and generating ideas. Not sure where to start, [here is a list of tools](https://www.futurepedia.io/). It's critial that when you use these tools you are very aware of bias and that you intervene to correct the text.

1. Can may use AI tools for any or all parts of the work.
    - If you do you must cite your work (as above).
    - If you do you must include a 500 word reflective essay about the experience as part of your self-evaluation.
2. Be very careful with reference. Many of these tools just make up random references.
3. I will __not__ use tools like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/faq#i-m-an-educator-who-has-f) to detect whether you have used AI tools or not. We are making a agreement to be honest with each other here. This is small class. We have that luxury. 

## COVID-19

The Department of Community Health and Epidemiology strives to be a leader in COVID-19 prevention. This is both an individual and collective challenge. If you feel sick or unwell, please do not come to class. Every accommodation will be made to support your learning if you are not able to come to class in person. If the University of Saskatchewan policy regarding COVID-19 changes during the course, I will update you as soon as possible and we will adapt the course as needed.

# Submitting Assignments 
All assignments should be submitted to the appropriate place in Canvas. All assignments are due at 5pm (CST) on the due date. Please don’t stay up until midnight to get the work done. Remember there are no late penalties so just take an extra day if you need and get some sleep. 

# Late and Missing Assignments
There is no penalty for late assignments. However, because many assignments have two or more parts, it is critical to the first assignment of the sections in around the due date. Missing assignments that are not submitted by the end of the course will receive a grade of zero.

# Access and Equity Services (AES)
Access and Equity Services (AES) is available to provide support to students who require accommodations due to disability, family status, and religious observances.

Students who have disabilities (learning, medical, physical, or mental health) are strongly encouraged to register with Access and Equity Services (AES) if they have not already done so. Students who suspect they may have disabilities should contact AES for advice and referrals at any time. Those students who are registered with AES with mental health disabilities and who anticipate that they may have responses to certain course materials or topics, should discuss course content with their instructors prior to course add / drop dates.

Students who require accommodations for pregnancy or substantial parental/family duties should contact AES to discuss their situations and potentially register with that office.

Students who require accommodations due to religious practices that prohibit the writing of exams on religious holidays should contact AES to self-declare and determine which accommodations are appropriate. In general, students who are unable to write an exam due to a religious conflict do not register with AES but instead submit an exam conflict form through their PAWS account to arrange accommodations.

Any student registered with AES, as well as those who require accommodations on religious grounds, may request alternative arrangements for mid-term and final examinations by submitting a request to AES by the stated deadliness. Instructors shall provide the examinations for students who are being accommodated by the deadlines established by AES.
