# Readings

I've created a Zotero Export file in RIS format with all of the reading PDFs and references. Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. Zotero links with Google Docs, Word, Latex and many other word processing tools. 
I strongly recommend you become familiar with Zotero as soon as possible. You can find the readings here [https://www.zotero.org/groups/5143700/chep816_usask](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5143700/chep816_usask).

If you want to go old school, all of the references including DOIs for each week are available below.
